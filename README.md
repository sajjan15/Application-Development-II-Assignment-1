## Game Description
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game where the goal is to align four tokens of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 6x7 grid. Players take turns dropping their tokens into columns, and the first player to achieve a line of four wins.

## Features

- **Win detection**: The game checks for a win after every move.
